Created a basic Convolutional Neural Network builder from scratch using only EJML libraries for efficient matrix computations. 
Currently has a example for predicting handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 

Network customization includes:
-network layout
-activation functions (e.g. sigmoid, Soft max)
-gradient descent methods (e.g. Stochasic Gradient Descent)
-weight initialization methods (e.g. He initialization)
-sampling methods (e.g. stratified sampling)

Functionalities:
-Save and load networks
-load training and validation datasets and test your networks
